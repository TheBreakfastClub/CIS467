## Game Engine

### Progress Reflection

### Problems Encountered

### Projected Progress
Throughout this first sprint, we have learned a lot about the complexity involved in building and designing a video game.  During these first stages of developing the game, it was critical that we were aware of the game design decisions that the team was making--that is, the decisions about how we wanted the game to look and play--because these decisions were intimately affecting the overall structure of how the game engine needed to be designed.  The primary example of this was that we originally projected making a tile-based video game, and we began coding the game engine accordingly.  However, it was decided by the game design group that the game was to now be based on a map of pixels rather than a map of tiles.  This caused us to rewrite a portion of our code to work with a pixel based map rather than a tile based map.  As we progress, our backlog will need to be changed accordingly to reflect creating a pixel based map, and the game engine team will have to constantly be meeting with the game engine team to make sure that everyone is on the same page.

Another change in our backlog is that we originally projected to create a game prototype by the end of the first sprint containing a world with simple pixelation and possibly a character that could be moved around the world. We were able to develop a much more complex prototype, however, with several different pixelation algorithms that we can test, a moving character with collision detection, and a customizable world. Even so, this code is not commented, is rather complex, and only one member of the team fully understands it.  It also does not fit into the well-documented framework that the rest of the game engine team has been creating.  Therefore, we are adjusting our backlog for our second sprint so that by the end of our second sprint, we plan to have taken the functionality of the prototype and migrated it into our framework, documenting the code, cleaning it up, and putting the code in a format that all members can understand.  This will give us a strong foundation to build the rest of the game from.  We also plan to include additional features into the game, primarily the ability to add enemies into the world. By the end of the second sprint, we plan on having a well-documented foundation that will allow us to add additional functionality easily and modularly and that will let us experiment with more advanced features.
