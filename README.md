Areas of Technical Innovation
-----------------------------
Our project aims to use the knowledge we have accumulated throughout our Computer Science degree at Grand Valley to create a professional and well designed product.  However, we also will be investigating several areas which we have limited or no prior experience with; this way we will push ourselves to grow, show our ability to self-learn, and gain new tools for our programming tool belts.  We call these research topics our areas of *technical innovation*, and they are as follows:

### - Video Game Development

### - Pixelinator: Investigating a Multi-Resolution Interface

With the large amount of 2D video games that are in existence today, games with a large variety of screen resolutions have been developed. Many of the original video games sported low resolution, highly pixelated displays, and new games will often imitate this resolution in order to maintain the retro appeal of these original games.  However, with increases in technology, it is not uncommon to play high resolution, well crafted games with highly tuned computer graphics.

When designing this game, we decided that we would like to take an innovative new approach: rather than make a game in only low resolution or only in high resolution, we would create a game that experiments with changing the resolution throughout the game.  In this way, the user would begin the game in a highly pixelated, low resolution world.  However, as the player progresses, they gain the ability to increase the resolution of the world around them or to decrease it back to the original resolution. When increasing the resolution, the player may find that what they thought was a solid wall actually contains a small door.  When dropping resolution, the player sees the logs in a river grow into a pixelated bridge.

Creating a game with a resolution-changing engine, what we call our *Pixelinator*, will surely involve research into how it can best be implemented. At a basic level, it will likely involve an averaging algorithm which takes the high resolution tiles in a section of the screen and replaces them with the average tile type contained within in order to decrease the resolution to a larger, simpler world.  But many more items will have to be taken into consideration, and we are looking forward to creating a multi-resolution interface.

### - Artificial Intelligence

The presence of enemies within a video game necessitates giving these enemies some sort of artificial intelligence.  While many of us have had some minor exposure to the concepts of A.I. and machine learning, none of us have implemented any complex level of game A.I.  We plan to research and implement different well-known artificial intelligence algorithms and also to create some of our own in order to grow our expertise in this fascinating area of computer science and to make our game more fun to play.  We are all very excited to dive into the field of A.I.  However, we plan to implement A.I. rather late in our development cycle, and we are well aware that due to the scope of this project, we may only have time to implement basic A.I. algorithms.
