## Game Design

### Progress Reflection
We have completed the design of the six items in the game: eggs, milk, flour, butter, baking powder, and sugar. Furthermore, we have nearly completed the design of four of the five levels of the game.

### Problems Encountered
Many of our problems lie in the changes made by the Game Engine team. For example, the main character now can rotate and pixellates as well. While this is functionality that we want, it changes the final design of the levels since we must ensure that the user can fit through all desired openings and cannot through others. This means that we need to go back and tweak some of the levels to allow for this new functionality.

### Projected Progress
During the final sprint, we will finalize the design of all levels and create the final level. We also plan to design and implement more enemy types to incorporate into the different levels. In conjunction with the Game Engine Team, we will use the newly created config file to help us define each of the levels, the placement of items, the placement of portals and where the portals take you, and the implementation of different emenies.
