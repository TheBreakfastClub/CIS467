Sprint 3 Report
Prepared by All Members.

## Game Engine

### Progress Reflection

### Problems Encountered

### Projected Progress
With the final sprint coming up, we plan to add as many additional features as we can, but we recognize that we may not get to them all in time.  We plan on finishing the configuration file so that items and enemies are pulled from the configuration file as well.  Another priority of the upcoming sprint is to give enemies the ability to push the hero and collide with the hero; this is needed for some of the level designs that the game design team wishes to implement.

Other than these items, there are several other items we would like to implement, if time. The first of these is to give the items different special abilities, as determined by the game design team.  We will also be working on additional enemy A.I.s.  The game design team would also like to create a world that uses a completely different pixelation algorithm, which they call "Little-Big World".  In this world, the world will get bigger around you in different pixelations instead of decreasing resolution. This requires some fundamental changes to the way the code is designed, so we may not be able to create it in time.  Also, if time, we will add music and sound effects.

## Game Design

### Progress Reflection
We have completed the design of the six items in the game: eggs, milk, flour, butter, baking powder, and sugar. Furthermore, we have nearly completed the design of four of the five levels of the game.

### Problems Encountered
Many of our problems lie in the changes made by the Game Engine team. For example, the main character now can rotate and pixilates as well. While this is functionality that we want, it changes the final design of the levels since we must ensure that the user can fit through all desired openings and cannot through others. This means that we need to go back and tweak some of the levels to allow for this new functionality.

### Projected Progress
During the final sprint, we will finalize the design of all levels and create the final level. We also plan to design and implement more enemy types to incorporate into the different levels. In conjunction with the Game Engine Team, we will use the newly created config file to help us define each of the levels, the placement of items, the placement of portals and where the portals take you, and the implementation of different enemies.
