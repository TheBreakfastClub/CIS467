##Ethical Reflection

1.01 Accept full responsibility for their own work.

Throughout each sprint, every group member has successfully taken full responsibility for their work. Every member was honest and thorough with the quality of any material they submitted. This was not only helpful, but necessary during times such as midterms when there was pressure from other classes.

3.02 Ensure proper and achievable goals and objectives for any project on which they work or propose.

This was one of the more difficult principles to follow while creating our project. While each group member wanted our game to be as successful as possible, we also needed to keep in mind the time constraints for this project. Although we tried to create obtainable goals during the feasibility study of the project, some aspects such as having several unique enemies and items became too difficult to complete in one semester. This is mainly due to most group members having no previous experience in game development.

6.01 Help develop an organizational environment favorable to acting ethically.

Each group member has encouraged ethical actions throughout the semester. Holy cow I have no idea what to say here.

6.08 Take responsibility for detecting, correcting, and reporting errors in software and associated documents on which they work.

Whenever a group member pushed new code to a branch, they were honest with any errors that existed within the code. If unknown bugs were discovered, the appropriate group member was notified and took responsibility with correcting the error.

8.02 Software engineers shall improve their ability to create safe, reliable, and useful quality software at reasonable cost and within a reasonable time.

Although it would be easy to create a program in an environment which every group member is familiar with; we wanted to use this opportunity to strengthen our coding abilities. We have successfully done this with each  group member exploring new coding opportunities such as creating in game AI.

7.02 Assist colleagues in professional development.

Each group member has done exceptionally well with reviewing each others work to help ensure the best code possible. In addition to that, each group member was very open to critiques by other members as well. 

7.05 Give a fair hearing to the opinions, concerns, or complaints of a colleague.

Each Friday the group met to discuss the status of the project as well as how to handle features within the code. During this time, all group members voiced and opinions and concerns towards and suggestions made. Even if a suggestion isnâ€™t as good as other ones, it was still treated with the same respect as any other suggestion.

8.09 Recognize that personal violations of this code are inconsistent with being a professional software engineer.

Every group member understood that violating the code of ethics was frowned upon and unprofessional. Because of this, no group member violated the code of ethics.
