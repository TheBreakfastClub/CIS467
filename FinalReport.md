##Abstract
Video games have become an influential part of today’s culture.  These games are often a large collection of complex and interacting components, and, because of this, the process to develop them can be quite intensive.  Our group decided to build a video game from scratch, allowing us to gain the experience of juggling the many different processes involved in video game development.

We created a top-down, two-dimensional video game. The main goal for this game is to make a waffle by collecting the six ingredients needed.  However, these items are scattered across five different worlds and different puzzles must be overcome in order to retrieve them.  To add a unique flair to our game, we decided to experiment with pixelation.  When the game is started, the user begins in a low-resolution, highly-pixelated world.  However, as the game progresses, the user gains the ability to increase the resolution of the world, and the user interacts with each resolution level differently.  In this way, we were able to create puzzles where choosing the correct resolution is the solution.

Throughout the game development, we faced many interesting and fun challenges.  In designing the game, we needed to create ways for items to interact and collide with each other, and we implemented pixel perfect collision detection to do this.  One key challenge of this project was implementing our own pixelation algorithms which could take a high resolution image and convert them to lower resolution images.  We also implemented our own path finding algorithms to improve enemy A.I. and had to make many design decisions so that the final game produced was something a user would want to play.

##Introduction
When playing a favorite video game, one does not usually think about how the game was made.  For a computer programmer, however, the large amount of complex and interacting components involved within video games can make developing a game an intriguing challenge.  As a group, we the Breakfast Club decided that we wanted to take on the challenges involved in developing a video game.   Rather than use those software development tools which can create much of a video game for you, we decided to create the game from the ground up, only using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) graphics library as an aid, which allowed us to gain direct access to the pixels on the screen.  By building our game from scratch, we would have experience creating all aspects of a video game and would have maximum control in designing the game just as we wanted.

We decided to create a 2D, top-down video game. In this game, the main goal is to collect the six ingredients needed to make a waffle—eggs, milk, butter, sugar, baking powder, and flour.  These items are scattered across five different worlds and different puzzles must be overcome in order to retrieve these items.  The primary unique feature we added to this game is pixelation.  When the game is started, the user begins in a low-resolution, highly-pixelated world.  As the game progresses, the user gains the ability to increase the resolution of the world to a medium resolution and to a high resolution.  The user is then able to interact with the world differently in these different resolutions.  For example, the high resolution world may contain skinny walls which fade away in the low resolution, creating a pathway.  Or, for example, the low resolution world may become blurry and too hard to navigate but increasing the resolution would make the pathway clearer.  In this way, puzzles are created by the varying levels of pixelation and resolution becomes the solution.

Because we created this game from the ground up, many aspects of the design had to be solidified early on in the game design phase.  For 2D games, worlds are usually defined either by using a tile based system—where the world is created by a set of repeating tiles, each with its own properties—or by using a pixel based system—where the world is completely defined by the individual pixels that make up the game map and the sprites.  To make the game play more flexible, we decided to use a pixel based system.  This design choice affected many other aspects of the game, including collision detection.  The two standard types of collision detection are bounding-box detection and pixel perfect collision detection. Because pixel perfect collision works well when using pixel based game systems, we decided to implement pixel perfect collision detection.  As we were working with the individual pixels, we created pixelation algorithms which could take a high resolution image and “pixelate” them, creating a lower resolution image.

While designing the game, we decided that it would be beneficial to add enemies into the game. However, in order to include the type of enemies that we wanted, we needed to create an artificial intelligence (A.I.) to control these enemies.  After creating a few prototype enemies with limited intelligence, we decided to implement enemies that used path finding algorithms.  The path finding algorithms we implemented allowed us to create smart enemies which could hunt down the hero, finding paths around most any obstacle in their way.

Aside from the software development, creating this game involved many purely design decisions.  For example, we needed to decide how the user was to control the hero, what the different worlds would look like, how the hero would interact with the environment, and how the game was to be won or lost.  Because these decisions affected the way the user would play and interact with the game at such a fundamental level, we decided to have two of our members devoted to making these decisions and creating the images defining the game worlds.

##Body

In software development the difference between a game and almost any other type of software is the mechanics of user interaction. After the initial core idea of creating a game utilizing the changing of pixel resolution we had to come up with a "reason" to change the resolution. This reason must be compelling and entertaining to make it a success as a game to play.

There were two areas that needed to be addressed to work out how to take the core idea and create a game around it. The first is how it will look. Not just what colors to use and what style it should be but since the resolution shifting has such a huge effect on this we needed to see how the visuals would change. Creating a quick and dirty prototype to see how images would change as the resolutions changed aided in understanding of what is not just possible but necessary. Because the visuals must be understood at high and low resolutions this prototype helped direct the visual style.

Working and playing with the prototype also lead into the second area we needed to address, how the game would play. Seeing how the images changed with the change in resolution helped inform not only the type of game we would make but how the feature would be utilized. The decision to make a puzzle type game was based on the fact that the change in resolution could force the user to think about how and when to change in order to reach a goal. And not to get into too much detail but with the shifting resolutions the game world and items change shape and to use this to reach the goal. It is the change in shape that solves the puzzles face by the user.

Developing the game mechanics and user interaction has been an investigative process. Working with and massaging the core idea of shifting resolution has evolved the our ideas of how the game is played.


Early on in the game's design the group decided that certain desirable features would only be implemented if time permitted. Once the core of the game matured enough so that group members could comfortably work on different aspects of the game in parallel, it was clear that some of those desirable features could be added. Pathfinding in particular seemed like a smart choice to spend some time on since we had already begun adding enemies.

To summarize our pathfinding system, it implements the A* search algorithm and searches through a grid-like representation of the game world. The grid representation of the world is initially created by analyzing raw pixel data from the game world's collision layer, adding a grid entry for each pixel in the image. Each grid entry at this stage contains data that determines whether that point on the grid is a wall or traversable ground. To cut down on memory consumption and time needed to calculate a path, only the lowest resolution image is used. It then calculates the hero's location and the location of all other enemies and adds that information to the grid. So, each grid space represents a type that is either a wall, ground, hero, or an enemy.

Without detailing exactly how the A* algorithm works, our implementation finds the optimal path from an enemy to the hero while taking into account only ground spaces and ignoring walls and spaces occupied by other enemies. Since the hero and enemies generally have the potential to move at any given point in time, the grid representation of the world must be rebuilt frequently in order to update their positions. The result of this frequent rebuilding of the grid is that the AI only needs to be concerned with moving towards the first grid space on the path to its destination. Having the AI take the entire path into account would be a waste of resources since the path is being continuously rebuilt.

##Pixelation and collision detection

Pixelation is implemented using some basic algorithms: point sampling, averaging, and most-used color. Each image is stored as a PNG file in it's highest resolution, and is downsampled at load time.

Collision detection is implemented much as one might expect; if a solid pixel of a sprite would overlap a solid pixel of the world's collision layer, or of another sprite, then that sprite/character cannot move to that location. Collision detection occurs both with the world map, and between sprites. Characters may push each other (and objects) around when so configured, and pushing works recursively for an arbitrarily long chain of objects. Initially we had planned to implement a sophisticated hierarchical bounding box system (probably quad-tree based), but given the paucity of items in the game world, combined with fairly efficient clipping tests, we chose to focus on other things.

One thing that is a bit unusual for a software renderer, is that everything is scaled up on the fly from its native size, using optimized fixed point math. All the pixelated images remain at very small scale in system memory. The engine also contains arbitrary rotation routines, including optional bilinear sampling, but those are only used at image load time, as we wanted to maintain "orthogonality" of pixelation while characters rotate.

##Ethical Reflection

1.01 Accept full responsibility for their own work.

Throughout each sprint, every group member has successfully taken full responsibility for their work. Every member was honest and thorough with the quality of any material they submitted. This was not only helpful, but necessary during times such as midterms when there was pressure from other classes.

3.02 Ensure proper and achievable goals and objectives for any project on which they work or propose.

This was one of the more difficult principles to follow while creating our project. While each group member wanted our game to be as successful as possible, we also needed to keep in mind the time constraints for this project. Although we tried to create obtainable goals during the feasibility study of the project, some aspects such as having several unique enemies and items became too difficult to complete in one semester. This is mainly due to most group members having no previous experience in game development.

6.01 Help develop an organizational environment favorable to acting ethically.

Each group member has encouraged ethical actions throughout the semester. We planned on addressing any ethical concerns one on one, but none arose.

6.08 Take responsibility for detecting, correcting, and reporting errors in software and associated documents on which they work.

Whenever a group member pushed new code to a branch, they were honest with any errors that existed within the code. If unknown bugs were discovered, the appropriate group member was notified and took responsibility with correcting the error.

8.02 Software engineers shall improve their ability to create safe, reliable, and useful quality software at reasonable cost and within a reasonable time.

Although it would be easy to create a program in an environment which every group member is familiar with; we wanted to use this opportunity to strengthen our coding abilities. We have successfully done this with each  group member exploring new coding opportunities such as creating in game AI.

7.02 Assist colleagues in professional development.

Each group member has done exceptionally well with reviewing each other's work to help ensure the best code possible. In addition to that, each group member was very open to critiques by other members as well.

7.05 Give a fair hearing to the opinions, concerns, or complaints of a colleague.

Each Friday the group met to discuss the status of the project as well as how to handle features within the code. During this time, all group members voiced and opinions and concerns towards and suggestions made. Even if a suggestion isn’t as good as other ones, it was still treated with the same respect as any other suggestion.

8.09 Recognize that personal violations of this code are inconsistent with being a professional software engineer.

Every group member understood that violating the code of ethics was frowned upon and unprofessional. Because of this, no group member violated the code of ethics.


#Conclusion

Although we have worked on many projects before; this capstone was a completely different experience with its size and scope. Unlike previous projects where the professor expects students to know all of the material of the project, each group member has explored new material during this time and has grown significantly. As important as learning new coding knowledge is; many valuable lessons on working in a large group for a large project were learned as well.

The most significant lesson learned was how important it is to have a clear set of requirements to meet. At the start of the semester we had grandiose ideas of what could be included in our game which seemed to change every week as more ideas were added. As the semester progressed though, it became apparent that new features needed to stop being added if we wanted to have a complete game by the end of the semester. If we would have had a meeting earlier in the semester to decide on a concrete set of features, it would have enforced the direction that the group needed to go for the game and less time would have been spent figuring out features which didn’t make it into the game.

Another significant lesson is that we needed to allow extra time for some features to take longer than expected. Although most game mechanics took roughly the time allotted to them, some mechanics such as dynamically changing the size of the hero took significantly longer than expected. If we had given some leniency for larger tasks,  it would have made the development of the game less stressful.

Finally, although we already knew this to an extent; we realized how significant communication was for this project. We met as a group at least once a week to discuss the status of the project and to divide up work among group members. We also used a service called Slack which was used to communicate between group members easily. We all agree that without this constant communication our game wouldn’t have been nearly as complete.

There were two main difficulties that were encountered during this project; the code structure having to be constantly reworked when new features were implemented, and only 2 of the 6 group members having any previous experience with game development experience.The code structure having to be reworked several times could have been avoided if we would have had decided on all game mechanics at the start of the sprint. Having the other group members explore game development was unavoidable, but wasn’t a problem once the project was started and members were able to take the time to learn how to use SDL 2.0.

Overall, this project went fairly smooth; but, there are some changes that could have been made to further smooth out the project.As stated in the lessons we learned, a main change that we would make is to take more time at the start of the sprint to decide on every game aspect so there would be less confusion on what features would be added in as the project progressed. Additionally, we believe that although meeting up once a week was key to this project’s success, it would have been even more helpful to meet more than once a week.

Although the semester has come to a close, we believe that our project can still be further expanded on. For example, we have implemented two types of enemies, but still have several other enemy types which we could add in. Additionally, more levels and item uses could still be implemented as well. Luckily, with the modularity of our code, implementing most of these features wouldn’t require a major reworking of the code.

Communication was a major factor to this project’s success; but wasn’t the only resource used to ensure our project’s success. We used a website called Slack which was used to create several personal chat rooms for the game engine, graphics, and design aspects. This allowed discussions to be organized and able to be referred back to. A GitHub repository was created as well with multiple branches to ensure that the master branch was always a properly working and presentable program. Finally, Trello was used to keep track of tasks needed for the current sprint.

Grand Valley has done a great job of preparing us for this project, but didn’t fully prepare all group members for every aspect of the project. Most group members didn’t have any previous experience with creating a graphics engine which made the start of the project slightly difficult. If a graphics course was offered more frequently more group members could have had more knowledge on the subject. Finally, although group work is encouraged in most CS courses, very few have large group work such as 4 or more students. This caused some minor trouble as we tried to determine the best method to divide up work between so many people. Although it is easy to say that our group was fairly large at 6 people, many companies will have us working with much more than 5 other people.
