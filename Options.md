Here are the options and the areas we get to choose.

# The world map

We need to figure out the structure of the game level.

1. There is a central level. In this level we collect all the items to make the waffle. Off of this level are "doorways" to other levels. These other levels are where you pick up the items. The sublevels can also be many things.
  1. They can represent different levels like a Mario or Zelda with forest, lava, desert and what not levels.
  2. They can represent the four elements: fire, water, wind, earth
  3. They can represent the four seasons.
  4. The levels can be based on the items that are picked up in that level.
2. Considering the timeframe it might be a good idea to just work on one big level. We could start out small and add to it iteratively as we figure out what we can get away with. The style can change in different areas if wanted and the items can be placed in different areas.



# The items
I have been debating the worth of keeping to the waffle idea, and there is still validity to not doing it. But I am still getting good ideas with the items.
1. Not using the waffle items as the main items to collect. Not sure what the items would be.
2. keeping the waffle items. But having these items skattered around and you cna pick them up and use them. There is a list of their uses in the manifesto. With this you will need to collect all and enough of the items to make the waffle. Could then have one item that is really had to get.
3. Keeping the waffle items. Having these items scattered around the one main level or in each separate level. but not having the items do anything.
4. or a mix of 2 and 3 where eggs and milk are usable items and having the others just pick up items.


# Pixelation
There are different things that the pixelation could do for the game mechanics.
1. After the player collects an item they gain a new pixelation algorithm to change the world differently.
2. There are several different collision layers that pixelate with different algorithms and then composite them together to make up the world.
3. each sublevel has their own pixelation algorithm giving the levels different kinds of obsiticels and puzzles to solve.

there are other possibilies that could be done.
