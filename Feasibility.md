Work Policy
-----------

The team has chosen to integrate the project with GitHub. Each member will contribute to the master branch in the GitHub repo only once the code has been well-tested, passes all tests, and everything functions as expected. Until that state has been acheived, new code will be written in separate branches. The branches will correspond to specific new features or tasks. Once the new feature has been implemented, the individual should pull from master and bring the most current code into the branch. All conflicts should be resolved and all tests passing before integrating the branch with master and pushing to the GitHub repository. At this time, the branch may also be deleted. This way, the master branch always has the latest green, working code that everyone can use and reference. It also will help to keep the repository clean by deleting branches once they are no longer in use. How each member chooses to use the branches created (beyond these instructions) will be up to the individual or the group that is working on any given feature. No member will be permitted to change code in a branch or delete a branch that he/she is not working with directly.
