# Sprint 1 Report
Prepared by All Members.

## Game Engine

### Progress Reflection

### Problems Encountered
Although the prototype from sprint 1 was functional, it wasn't easy to understand and wasn't structured very well. Therefore, for this sprint we decided to take that prototype and structure it to make it easier to understand and more efficient. However, this task was more difficult to accomplish than previously expected since new ideas for code implementation were constantly being considered. This problem was overcome by meeting for a few hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to discuss what needed to be accomplished in order to finish the sprint on time and trouble shoot any problems. Other smaller problems that were encountered were personal conflicts such as midterms happening during sprint 2.

### Projected Progress
We were able to make a large amount of progress throughout this sprint in migrating the code from our prototype into a well-documented framework.  However, not all of the code was documented well during migration, and we have decided to add cleaning up and documenting this code to our backlog as part of our third sprint. We feel that it would be beneficial to clean up this code a bit because some of it is foundational code that the rest of the game relies on and uses a lot; therefore, it will be easier to further develop the game once this code is cleaned up.

Furthermore, upon consulting with the game design team, we decided that we should also add creating a configuration file to the backlog for our next sprint. There are many different properties of the game world that the game design team would like to be able to easily change, including the pictures defining the different game worlds and sprites, item locations, and the initial location of the hero. However, the constants defining these items are currently scattered through several files in the code and require one to recompile the code after changing these items. We plan to create a configuration file that allows the game design team to easily specify all of these properties about the world in one text file. This will make updating the world significantly easier for them and help facilitate game development.pi

There are several other tasks we would like to complete by the end of the next sprint. At the beginning of this sprint, we had wanted to add enemies to the game. However, the team as a whole decided that items were more important to the game play than enemies were and thus we implemented items during this sprint. We hope to add enemies into the third sprint now that we have the basic game engine requirements completed. Also, the current algorithm used to detect collisions between sprites is inefficient. One top priority of the next sprint is to improve this.  Some other items we may implement in the next sprint, if there is time, is adding in music/sound effects and adding in sprite rotation. However, we may decide to not implement sprite rotation in order to keep a more consistent game dynamic.

## Game Design

### Progress Reflection
We made final decisions regarding design aspects such as the number of levels, the capabilities that the hero will have, the number of items the hero will pick up, and the overall feel of the game and world map. We have been able to communicate with the game engine team about our ideas and what we need from them to accomplish want we want. We now have a grand vision that we can use as a road map for the design team. For example, each of the different levels will likely implement a different pixelation algorithm to give each level a unique set of puzzles to solve. Furthermore, we have nearly completed the design of two levels of our game, which we can test and interact with using the game engine team's prototypes.

### Problems Encountered
Between Michelle's computer needing significant repairs to be usable, midterms, and individually hectic schedules, not as much was able to be accomplished this sprint. We hope that the computer can be repaired and returned within the next couple of weeks. Furthermore, schedules might become less busy as midterms conclude and individual conflicts resolving.

### Projected Progress
We hope to finish the design of each of the levels, the hero character, and the items by the end of the next sprint. When all the levels being "done" in the next sprint, the sprint after next will be used for polish. Having a game to play over and over we should be able to finesse the level design to something that is great. However, due to how much we were able to accomplish this sprint, we will be pushing off the design and implementation of enemies until the last sprint.
