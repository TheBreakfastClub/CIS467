## Game Design

### Progress Reflection
We made final decisions regarding design aspects such as the number of levels, the capabilities that the hero will have, the number of items the hero will pick up, and the overall feel of the game and world map. We have been able to communicate with the game engine team about our ideas and what we need from them to accomplish want we want. We now have a grand vision that we can use as a road map for the design team. For example, each of the different levels will likely implement a different pixellation algorithm to give each level a unique set of puzzles to solve. Furthermore, we have nearly completed the design of two levels of our game, which we can test and interact with using the game engine team's prototypes.

### Problems Encountered
Between Michelle's computer needing significant repairs to be usable, midterms, and individually hectic schedules, not as much was able to be accomplished this sprint. We hope that the computer can be repaired and returned within the next couple of weeks. Furthermore, schedules might become less busy as midterms conclude and individual conflicts resolving.

### Projected Progress
We hope to finish the design of each of the levels, the hero character, and the items by the end of the next sprint. Whan all the levels being "done" in the next sprint, the sprint after next will be used for polish. Having a game to play over and over we should be able to finess the level design to something that is great. However, due to how much we were able to accomplish this sprint, we will be pushing off the disign and implementation of enemies until the last sprint.
